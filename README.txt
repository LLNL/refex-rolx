(1) run_refex_rolx.sh calls the GenerateFeatures class to generate
features when the set of features is unknown.  If the set of features
is known, then you need to use CalculateFeatures class (run_fixed.sh
demonstrates this).

(2) There are sample input data in sample-data/ directory

(3) The output are:

out-featureNames.csv: feature names extracted by ReFex
out-featureValues.csv: feature values extracted by ReFex
out-nodeRoles.txt: node-by-role matrix
out-roleFeatures.txt: role-by-feature matrix
out-ids.txt: each line is the nodeID for the corresponding row in out-nodeRoles


Notes:
For descriptions of the feature naming convention, see Egonet.java.
